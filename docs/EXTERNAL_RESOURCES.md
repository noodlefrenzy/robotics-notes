## IsaacSim and IsaacLab

If you don't have a fancy (say gaming) GPU on your personal device, the fastest (yet expensive) way to run Isaac would be [one of these](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/nvidia.isaac_sim_developer_workstation)

### Official NVIDIA Isaac Sim Tutorials

- NVIDIA has [online courses](https://nvdam.widen.net/s/brxsxxtskb/dli-learning-journey-2009000-r5-web) on isaaclab/isaacsim, some of which are free, and some good tutorials [here](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/robot_setup_tutorials/index.html).
- [Isaac Sim Quickstart](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/introduction/quickstart_index.html): NVIDIA’s official quickstart tutorial introduces navigation of the GUI, adding objects to the stage, looking up basic properties, and running simulations. Tutorial covers both GUI and Python scripting workflows for maximum flexibility.
- [Basic Robot Tutorial](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/introduction/quickstart_isaacsim_robot.html): Walks through adding a robot (e.g., Franka Emika Panda Arm) to the simulation, moving it, and examining robot properties.

### Community and Supplementary Tutorials

- A random [blogpost](https://lycheeai-hub.com/isaac-lab/projects/isaac-lab-reach-task-ur10-with-gripper) which was surprisingly well written.
- Isaac Sim in Under Half an Hour ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjVqOqEXXrY)): Excellent beginner walkthrough covering install, usage, running Isaac ROS example, reinforcement learning, Docker, and streaming mode setup.
- [Isaac Lab Tutorials](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/tutorials/index.html): Step-by-step Python tutorial scripts covering simulation launch, asset interaction, creating scenes, environment design, and sensor integration—great for hands-on learning.
- [Stereolabs Getting Started](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/isaac-sim/isaac_sim): Practical installation and workflow guide for using Isaac Sim with ZED cameras and setting up an environment from scratch using official NVIDIA methods.
- Beginner’s Guide to Isaac Sim ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beginners-guide-isaac-sim-what-how-use-the-next-tech-jjfsc)): Overview of installing Omniverse Launcher, downloading Isaac Sim, configuring dependencies (Python, ROS, GPU drivers), and initializing the development environment.
- Isaac Sim Office Hours ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL4mbskJSVI)): Introductory video sessions and discussion for both robotics beginners and developers.

### Key Starting Points

- Always begin with the Isaac Sim official documentation—especially the Quickstart and Basic Usage tutorials—which are regularly updated by NVIDIA.
- Supplement with video walkthroughs and Python script-based examples for hands-on experience.
- For robotics workflows, review guides that include ROS integration and Omniverse ecosystem benefits.
- Explore demos and example scripts bundled within Isaac Sim’s installation directory for immediate practical exposure.
