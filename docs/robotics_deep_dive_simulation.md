## 1. Scope

Survey of major simulators (Isaac Sim, Gazebo Harmonic, Webots, Mujoco, Habitat-Sim) and digital twin practices for robotics training, validation, and synthetic data.

## 2. Comparative Overview

| Simulator | Physics | Strengths | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Isaac Sim | PhysX | RTX, synthetic data, USD extensibility | Strong for photoreal + GPU scaling |
| Gazebo (Harmonic) | ODE/DART plugins | ROS 2 native workflow | Modular sensors |
| Webots | ODE | Rapid prototyping | Integrated robot models |
| Mujoco | Mujoco | Precise contacts, RL favored | Less built-in ROS tooling |
| Habitat-Sim | Rigid body | Photoreal nav/manip scenes | Embodied AI focus |

## 3. Digital Twin Fidelity Dimensions

- Geometry accuracy (CAD → USD).
- Material & optical realism (PBR, lighting GI correctness).
- Dynamics parameter matching (mass, friction, joint damping).
- Sensor modeling (noise, latency, rolling shutter, distortions).
- Temporal determinism (lockstep stepping for RL reproducibility).

## 4. Synthetic Data Pipeline

1. Asset ingestion (CAD → USD + semantic labels).
2. Domain randomization (textures, lights, clutter, physics params).
3. Ground truth rendering (segmentation, depth, normals, flow, 6D poses).
4. Dataset curation (balance long-tail object instances).
5. Model training / validation loop.

## 5. Scaling Parallel Simulation

- Headless multi-GPU instancing (Isaac Farm style) vs. batched physics (Brax approach).
- Process vs. thread isolation for determinism.
- Checkpointing world states for curriculum stages.

## 6. Time & Synchronization

- ROS 2 simulated time injection.
- Deterministic stepping barrier for RL frames.
- Sensor publication jitter metrics & mitigation.

## 7. HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop)

- Replace simulated sensors with real streams gradually.
- Latency insertion to emulate network & actuator delays.
- Safety sandbox: constrained velocity envelopes during early tests.

## 8. Validation & Drift Monitoring

- Reprojection error of camera calibration against real logs.
- Force/torque trace comparison under identical motion scripts.
- Pose tracking error between simulated vs. measured trajectories.

## 9. Performance Profiling

KPIs: Simulation step time budget, sensor frame time, GPU memory per environment, physics broadphase % of frame.
Tools: Nsight, built-in sim profilers, ros2_tracing.

## 10. Common Pitfalls

- Unrealistic friction leading to policy overfitting.
- Missing sensor timing noise causing brittle real deployment.
- Over-randomization degrading convergence.
- Non-deterministic thread scheduling hiding race conditions.

## 11. Research / Expansion Tasks

| Task | Goal | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| Add multi-GPU headless scaling benchmark | Throughput | High |
| Build sensor latency variance harness | Timing fidelity | Medium |
| Implement dynamic curriculum checkpoint loader | Training efficiency | Medium |
| Compare photoreal vs stylized domain randomization | Transfer study | Low |
| Integrate physics parameter identification loop | Reality gap closure | High |
